# change.org voter
Generates [change.org](https://change.org/) accounts and automatically votes on polls for you.

# Config
The config consists of a proxy, I use proxylabs and it works well. There's also a "pID" which is the ID of the petition you're trying to sign, you can get this by opening chrome dev tools, going to network tab, signing the petition, then finding the `https://www.change.org/api-proxy/-/signatures/` link, the numbers after `signatures/` is the pID.
